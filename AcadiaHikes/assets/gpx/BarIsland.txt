Bar Island Path
When the tide is low enough, a sand bar connects Bar Harbor to Bar Island, which is a small separate piece of Acadia Park. After a short hike, we got a view back towards Bar Harbor. On the sandbar there were many gulls and the remnants of the crabs they ate along with a few very small sea stars under rocks.
