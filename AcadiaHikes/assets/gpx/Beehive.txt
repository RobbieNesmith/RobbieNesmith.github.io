Beehive/Gorham Mountain/Ocean Path
After a bit of scrambling and walking along cliffside ledges, we were rewarded with excellent views of the ocean from the top of The Beehive, as well as along the ridge of Gorham mountain. To close the loop we followed the Ocean Path, which passed by Thunder Hole, which was unfortunately not thundering at the time.
