Goat Path/Hadlock Pond
This hike treated us with a great variety of environments. Starting with an intense scramble up the rocky Goat Path through a lush and mossy forest, we then traversed the ridge of the arid Norumbega Mountain with scrubby conifers. When we descended, we were greeted with a stunning view across the Lower Hadlock Pond where we stopped for lunch. Beyond this, we followed some forest paths of varying wetness to return to Upper Hadlock Pond and our starting point.
