Jordan Pond
This was the first hike we took after arriving in the park. It is a flat loop around a large pond with excellent views of the fall colors of the trees on the nearby slopes. From the south of the pond we could also see the distinctive "bubbles", the pair of rounded mountains just north of the pond.
