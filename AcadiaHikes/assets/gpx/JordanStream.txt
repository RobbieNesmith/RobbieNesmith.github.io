Jordan Stream
Looking for a bit more hiking before it started getting dark, we followed the carriage paths south of the Jordan Pond House, but then discovered a trail that followed the Jordan Stream. This took us through beautiful lush forests, then met up with a carriage path to take us back at a historic cobblestone bridge.
