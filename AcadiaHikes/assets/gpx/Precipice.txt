Precipice
We climbed and climbed for this one. After many boulders and metal ladder rungs drilled into the rock face, we reached the peak, only to be surrounded in fog. The fog did give a secluded feeling, which was cool in its own way. On the return journey we slowly descended down rocky paths, getting a view of the Jackson Laboratory to the north of the park. Once we crossed the road, it was a nice flat hike through a yellow forest.
