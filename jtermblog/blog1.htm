<h2>Seattle Day 1</h2>
<h3>In which the world of startups is revealed, I build a blog, and everything is out of batteries</h3>
<p>
Kirby and I started off the morning by visiting a nearby coffee shop and getting some macchiatos.
The shop is about two blocks from the house we are staying in, so it is very easy to get to.
In Seattle, most non-chain coffee shops will pull their shots ristretto, which in short means that they are smaller and more concentrated.
Upon this realization I was very happy, because this is the way that it is done at Brewed Awakenings in Cedar Rapids, where I work, and where I became an espresso drinker.
After this we got to know each other and discussed some of the themes of the class.
Everyone questioned the boundaries of what we consider technology and what we consider the common good.
A thought that came up were how many people or what percent of people does something have to benefit for it to be considered "common good".
It turns out that it is very difficult to define the "common good" because no matter what is done, it will positively affect some people and negatively affect some people, and these categories are not necessarily mutually exclusive.
For example, building a highway might displace some people, but these people may also use the benefits of transportation and shipping from the highway.
I thought I had an idea of the common good earlier, but now it seems like there is nothing that is truly for the common good.

After a lunch of peanut butter ramen (no surprise there), we left to go visit the startup Meld.
It was initially founded by someone who worked with our professor at Net Perception, the former search reccomendation platform for Amazon.
The original goal at Meld was to create a temperature sensative pan that would connect to an attachment on the stove knob for precise control.
They were recently bought by Meyer, a large California based kitchenware company.
While we were there, we learned about the life of a startup and why selling out to a large company can be extremely helpful in the later stages of development.
It turns out that there were many legal considerations that the lawyers of Meyer wanted to look over with Meld's knob controller before it was released.
There is a lot of liability with something that automatically controls fire.
We also learned that as someone in a tech field, it is quite easy to switch jobs or start a startup.
In most cases, if you leave a company and then try to come back, they will accept you back.

Before we had left, I plugged in my Surface so it would charge while we were away.
When we came back, it had picked up 9% of charge.
In the future, when I look back on this trip, I will remember it as the time that I learned about the different amperages of USB chargers.
Luckily, I managed to find one on Amazon that will be a suitable replacement.

On a side note, writing this blog from scratch may have been a bad idea.
It is currently still under construction.
