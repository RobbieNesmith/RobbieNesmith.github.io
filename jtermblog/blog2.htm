<h2>Seattle Day 2</h2>
<h3>In which I find espresso that tastes like mine, have plenty of tablets, and try not to fanboy too hard</h3>
<p>
They say that anything that happens twice is a tradition. Or maybe they don't. Either way, the tradition of starting the day with a local espresso shop was continued, only this one turned out to be a sneaky chain. "What coffee chain" you ask, "would disguise itself like this?" Well the answer is surprising. Roy Street Coffee and Tea is actually Starbucks. They're just trying to be... not Starbucks.

<p>I'll give them that, when I asked for a macchiatto, they pulled a ristretto shot with coffee that didn't have the distinctive burnt Starbucks taste. I think that this style of Starbucks only exists in Seattle, but it will be interesting to see if they push the style of the shop (or ristretto) anywhere else.

Following this, we discussed the economic and racial disperities in tech jobs. Since my Surface was still low on power, I switched to my phone, but then decided it would work better to just use a notebook. After looking into the rhetoric of the argument that there are races that are underrepresented, we decided to look at the racial breakdown of tech jobs in comparison to the racial breakdown of the United States as a whole. After this, we questioned what it would be like in comparison to the racial breakdown of college graduates. I think that the racial disparity in hiring for tech companies is mainly due to racial discrimination in education. If society finds a way to incentivize higher education, I think this will help the issue of people not getting far enough to make it into high-paying tech fields.

In the afternoon, we visited a Luther grad at Microsoft. He and two other Microsoft employees told of their positions in the company. There are some aspects that are similar to and some different from working at a startup company. Even in a large company such as Microsoft, there are many small organizations some of which consist of a small number of people and pioneer new ideas. However when working for a large company, funding is much less of an issue. As long as a project is deemed worthwhile, it can tap into the well established economic force of the company. As well as this there are more management positions (at least compared to the single digit workforce of Meld), in order to coordinate the teams.

Similarly to Starbucks, Microsoft is not always viewed in a positive light. Due to the multi-year spacing between releases of Windows, Microsoft has seemed to be a bit behind the times. Especially since they switched to the new CEO, Satya Nadella, Microsoft (like Starbucks) has moved towards being a more hip company, pushing more frequent updates, engaging in charity work, and adding a sculpture of Ninja Cat to their commons building. Now Microsoft allows plenty of opportunities for community outreach. They will match donations to charities and donate to organizations where employees volunteer.

I decided beforehand that bringing my surface to Microsoft and acting like a total fanboy would probably not get me a charger, so I decided against it. Unfortunately I was too engrossed with the various Kinect demos that were set up in the visitors' center and missed my chance to buy a shirt. Next time.
