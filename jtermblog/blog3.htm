<h2>Seattle Day 3</h2>
<h3>In which we visit Amazon, I go rock climbing, and Amazon saves my life</h3>

As usual, I'll begin with my daily coffee adventure. I should mention, all of these coffee shops are within about two minutes walking distance. Coffee shops are pretty common in Seattle. Today's venue, Joe Bar, was very nice. They had an interesting seating area with a sort of balcony above the bar. The macchiato that I ordered was quite delicious. Living up to the name of Joe Bar, they had joe and also a bar. What stood out to me is that they served gluhwein. It seemed like an unusual beverage for a shop with such a small alcoholic bar to have.

Our discussion this morning followed a video of a talk by Peter Griffin (according to Sergei). His name is actually Guy Kawasaki and he is a venture capitalist and former Apple Evangelist. He gave 10 tips on how to start a startup without seeming generic to the venture capitalists from which you want money. His tips included  polarizing your audience to not try to please everyone, and the 10 20 30 rule which says that you should have 10 slides in your powerpoint, it should last 20 minutes, and you should use at least 30 point font.

Our tech visit of the day was to Amazon, which was fitting because my charger was due to arrive later in the day. We met with Peter Hill, who worked with Professor Miller and joined Amazon back when it was a small startup company. He was able to recount the growth of the online bookstore into a now massive tech empire. Amazon tests their ideas internally before releasing them to the entire world to make sure that they are something that people would use. On a side note, they use Amazon river themed code names for their projects. When asked about robots replacing people in manufacturing jobs, Peter explained his reasoning which matched well with my beliefs. He justified it by saying that these jobs put people in unecessary risk, and that by using robots instead, we could reduce this risk.

After this, Kirby Aiden and I went to the Seattle Bouldering Project, which is a large building with padded floors and a bunch of bouldering problems set up all over the place. The routes were colored by difficulty, so we could somewhat figure out which ones would be appropriate for our skill level. However, climbing at Luther lacks large overhangs. Not being used to these made the overhung problems much more difficult. I brought my GoPro, so there will be a video of this at some point.

When I arrived back at the house, my Amazon package of a charger was waiting for me! I tested it out, and it actually had enough power to charge my Surface while it was on! I have so much freedom now, I don't have to conserve battery for a day to actually use it!
