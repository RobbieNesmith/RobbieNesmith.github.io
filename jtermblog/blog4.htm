<h3>In which my Surface lies, card games are played, and Amtrak is awesome</h3>
<p>
I woke up this morning to find that my Surface had been charged by my new charger...to a pitiful 43%. It seems that it played the charging animation in the notification bar for a short time, then realized that there was not enough juice to power it. Having charged it for a long period of time before this, I pulled it out of the charger before it told me of this problem. Looks like I'll have to return to Amazon soon. As soon as I get home, I'm going to buy a multimeter and figure out everything about USB and how it charges things. Or doesn't.

Fortunately, the shop on the Amtrak train sells decks of cards. A group of us played some card games during the beginning of the trip while it was light out. We played BS and Uno (Somebody brought a deck of Uno cards as well) so it was a throwback to middle school playing these games at lunch. Unfortunately, the game Mao also surfaced. For those who don't know, Mao is a game that starts off with only one person who knows the rules and everyone else needs to figure them out. For example, the first rule of Mao is that there is no talking about the rules of Mao.

As well as this, I had the book The Martian to finish. I would definitely recommend this book to fans of science fiction, especially fans of Apollo 13. I couldn't help but see some parallels between Mark Watney's logs and my blogging. I could totally relate to his struggle to power all of his devices. Only his were important to survival. Also he was stranded on an uninhabited desert planet. Also he didn't have Amazon prime. OK, the parallels are terrible I'll stop now. Anyway, the book deals with using available materials to complete necessary tasks. It is awesome to see the progress of the botanist/mechanical engineer Watney as he scavenges equipment to extend his life. I won't spoil anything, go check it out. Now that I've finished the book, I need to see the movie to see how it stacks up.

After finishing the book, it was time for dinner, and this led to an interacton that could really have only been possible on a train. Meal seating is done by reservation, but if your table is not full, you will be seated with other people from the train. Because of this, Kirby and I were seated with Cynthia and Allyson, two women from the Boston area on vacation to the west coast. We had a very interesting conversation with them, tradimg our stories of the J-Term class for their stories of working with technology for the Boston Globe and MIT. They told of working on features that by today's standards may seem trivial, but at the time were crucial to bring the newspaper into the future. These included the ability to request classified ads over the phone and pay for the newspaper using a credit card. It turns out the Boston Globe is one of the most technologically advanced newspapers, always trying to integrate the latest and greatest in order to keep up with the technology of the time. I found this interesting, a prime example of the prevalence of new technology working its way into old technology. It is amazing all of the different places where themes of our class show up.
