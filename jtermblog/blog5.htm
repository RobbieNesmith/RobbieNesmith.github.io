<h2>Menlo Park Day 1</h2>
<h3>In which California is green again, we get a fancy hotel, and I meet Kirby's brother</h3>
<p>
This morning I woke up very early. I have a hard time sleeping on moving vehicles, and it seems trains are no exception. After wondering how I would tell if anyone was awake and ready for breakfast, a few people from the group came down the hall asking if I wanted to get breakfast. At the breakfast table we shared some riddles, and then head over to the observation car to relax. As we drew closer to our destination, we drove past many large hills. (or grassy mountains, I'm not sure which) The scenery was much different from when I came to California last time, because this time there had been rain. Everything was green and pretty as opposed to the brown crunchy wasteland it was two years ago.

We pulled into the station and dragged our baggage out into the parking lot. After waiting around for a while and speculating what cars we would have as rental cars, a pair of Dodge SUVs pulled up. Unfortunately, the rental place did not have the cars that we had originally wanted, so we ended up with smaller ones. Luckily they were just the right size. Not "just the right size" as in ample room, but "just the right size" as in we were so tightly packed in that Sergei had two large suitcases on his lap and I was curled in the fetal position in order to jam myself into the last remaining seat. It worked perfectly, we still made it to the hotel.

Once we had gotten situated, Kirby Aiden and I walked down the street to a pizza place called Applewood pizza. It was very delicious. After we returned to the hotel, we got a ride from Kirby's brother to his apartment for some board games. We played a game called Caylus in which we took on the roles of masons seeking the king's favor by building more of the new castle than the other players. It was a lot of fun, even though I came in dead last. Following the game, we went to Armadillo Willy's BBQ for dinner. We got the family platter called "The Belly Buster" which was an assortment of ribs, BBQ chicken, and sausage. Even between the four of us, we didn't finish it.

Following dinner, we returned to Kirby's brother's apartment for some Dominion, which I didn't lose. I didn't win either, but the main point is not losing. I also tried a beer called Xocoveza which is Mexican chocolate themed. It was pretty good, kind of like a Don Corralejo in beer form, but I think I'll stick to the espresso version.
