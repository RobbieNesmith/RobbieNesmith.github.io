					<h3>Palm M100</h3>
					<img src="img/m100.jpg" />
					<p>I bought this one at a garage sale some time ago for $3. I used it for a while in high school to take notes before replacing it with an M505. It came with all the stock accessories including an ad for the Kodak PalmPix camera.</p>

					<h3>Palm M130</h3>
					<img src="img/m100.jpg" />
					<p>I got this one in a lot with my M515 and Tungsten E in 2020. This is the first palm in the m100 series to have a color display. It looks pretty nice when nothing is moving, but has very bad ghosting that makes games with small moving objects hard to play (looking at you Hardball)</p><p>I still need to replace the battery in this guy and see if I can recalibrate or fix the digitizer.</p>
					<p>Replaced battery: No but I need to</p>

					<h3>Palm M505</h3>
					<img src="img/m100.jpg" />
					<p>I originally got an M505 when I was in high school when my brother bought a lot on eBay with a Tungsten T2. Unfortunately that one broke, but I used it for taking notes and during that time got pretty good at the Graffiti alphabet.</p><p>My current M505 is from my uncle who posted a picture of some "Palm crap" that he was getting rid of. Naturally I saw this as a great opportunity and asked him to send them over.</p>
					<p>Replaced battery: yes</p>

					<h3>Palm M515</h3>
					<img src="img/m100.jpg" />
					<p>Included in the lot with the M130 and the Tungsten E, the 515 is Palm's response to the complaints about the M505's abysmal screen light. This one is truly an improvement with a much brighter and clearer backlit screen. I do wish they kept the lit graffiti area though.</p><p>When I first got this Palm the digitizer did not work. I'm pretty sure that the cable had been displaced by how swollen the battery was. I only had to take off one screw and I could tell that the battery was so puffed it was pressing on the case. After reseating the digitizer cable and putting in a fresh battery it runs great.</p>
					<p>Replaced battery: yes</p>

					<h3>Palm Tungsten E</h3>
					<img src="img/m100.jpg" />
					<p>The third Palm of the lot, the Tungsten E was the initial low end offering of the Tungsten series. Despite its placement in the hierarchy, it is quite a nice device. Along with the higher end T models, the Tungsten E has a high resolution screen and a proper speaker. I really need to replace the battery in this one because it's quite nice to use.</p>

					<h3>Palm T|X</h3>
					<img src="img/m100.jpg" />
					<p>I got this Palm from my uncle as well and it is the newest one I have so far. Equipped with modern conveniences of Wifi and Bluetooth I can... well not do a whole lot since it doesn't support modern encryption. It also has a more modern 480*320 screen which makes it a bit more useful as a portable media player.</p>
					<p>Replaced battery: Yes</p>
